[{"content":"The Crazy Summer Temperature Before my grand Texan adventure, I was living in San Diego, Califonia. The weather was perfect in summer - warm, but not too hot, with a gentle breeze that made every day feel like a vacation. The beaches were my happy place, and I soaked up the sun like a true Californian.\nBut life had different plans, and I found myself venturing to Texas. When I decided to move to Austin last August, I thought I was prepared for the heat I heared before setting off. However, nothing could have prepared me for the wild heat of Austin - a heat that seemed to have a life of its own!\nExpecting the heat in Austin to be similar to what I experienced in Jiangsu, where I was born and raise up, I was in for a shock! Not only did the daytime temperatures reach scorching heights, but the real surprise came at sunset. Unlike anywhere else I\u0026rsquo;ve been, Austin\u0026rsquo;s nights can be hotter than the mornings!\nAs the sun goes down, instead of the expected relief, the temperatures often reach their peak, leaving you drenched in sweat even during a simple walk outside. Midnight feels like a cruel joke, as the thermometer shows no mercy and the heat refuses to subside.\nTemperature peaks at sunset Invading Insects Living in Austin certainly comes with its fair share of insect encounters!\nCats live toys My cats are the masters of surprises, always keeping me on my toes with their incredible hunting skills. They never fail to find something intriguing, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a tiny critter crawling on the ground or a pesky fly buzzing in the air.\nMy Cats Outdoor barbecue is not food for you On Independence Day, I had the pleasure of experiencing the true warmth of Texas hospitality at my neighbor\u0026rsquo;s barbecue. The Texan folks are undoubtedly friendly and welcoming, making the gathering a delightful affair. The mouthwatering spread of Texas-style barbecue was a feast for the senses, with tender meats and savory sides that celebrated the essence of Texan cuisine. However, amidst the joyous celebration, the buzzing presence of flies proved to be an uninvited annoyance. I found myself constantly whisking them away, making it challenging to savor the delectable food as much as I would have liked.\nBig Ants everywhere Adding to the insect encounters, mornings in Austin often greet me with unexpected visitors in my cup - ants! It\u0026rsquo;s a common occurrence to find these tiny creatures drowned in my cup. As much as I try to keep my surroundings clean, these persistent ants find their way into my morning routine, requiring me to be vigilant in checking my cups before taking a drink.\nPerhaps it\u0026rsquo;s time to reach out to a pest control service to address the issue but I have decided to move back.\n","permalink":"https://howardhu.me/posts/crazy-austin-summer/","summary":"The Crazy Summer Temperature Before my grand Texan adventure, I was living in San Diego, Califonia.
